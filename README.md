"Today’s topic is a BIG one: Should you learn to code in 2025? Maybe you’ve heard things like, 'AI is taking over; coding is pointless!' or 'Everyone needs to know how to code to survive in the future!' So, what’s the real deal?"

"Whether you’re a student exploring your career path, a professional wondering if coding can supercharge your job, or someone just itching for a change, you’re in the right place. Stick around, and by the end of this video, you’ll know if learning to code in 2025 is worth your time."

[Cut to text on screen: “Let’s dive in!” with a sound effect.]

"So, let’s start with the obvious question: Is coding still relevant in 2025?"

"Short answer? YES! But it’s not as simple as it used to be. The tech world has changed a lot in just the past few years. AI tools like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and low-code platforms are doing some heavy lifting for developers. Some people even think this means coding is dead. But that couldn’t be further from the truth."

"Here’s the thing: AI can assist with coding, but it can’t replace you. It’s great at writing snippets of code or debugging simple problems, but it still needs a human mind to connect the dots, solve complex problems, and build things that actually work in the real world. Think of AI as your coding sidekick — not your replacement."

"Learning to code in 2025 isn’t just about typing lines of code; it’s about developing problem-solving skills, understanding systems, and learning how to collaborate with AI to do amazing things."

"Now, let’s talk about who should learn coding."

"Students, listen up!"
"If you’re a student, learning to code is one of the smartest moves you can make. It’s not just about getting a tech job someday; it’s about understanding the digital world we live in. Want to make an app, automate boring tasks, or ace that computer science class? Coding gives you a head start."

"Professionals, this one’s for you!"
"If you’re already working and want to level up your career, coding can give you a HUGE edge. For example, marketers can use coding to analyze data, automate reports, and build better campaigns. Finance pros? You can automate spreadsheets or even dabble in algorithmic trading. No matter your field, coding is like adding a Swiss Army knife to your skillset."

"Career changers, I see you!"
"Thinking about switching careers? Coding can open doors to exciting jobs like web development, data analysis, or even game design. The best part? Many tech jobs don’t require a college degree — just skills, and the willingness to learn. If you’re ready to invest some time, you could start a whole new career in tech."

"What type of coding should you learn in 2025?"

"Great question, because coding isn’t a one-size-fits-all skill. Here are some popular paths, depending on your interests:"

"For web development, learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and dive into frameworks like React or Next.js. The internet isn’t going anywhere, and web developers are always in demand."
"For mobile development, check out Swift for iOS apps or Flutter for cross-platform apps. Smartphones are in everyone’s hands — why not build what they use every day?"
"If you’re into AI and machine learning, Python is your best friend. It’s used in everything from building chatbots to creating predictive models."
"For automation and scripting, Python and JavaScript are excellent tools. Automate repetitive tasks, save time, and make your life easier!"
"Pick one area that excites you and start small. You don’t have to learn everything at once — just one step at a time."

"But what if coding isn’t for you?"

"Let’s be real: Coding isn’t for everyone, and that’s okay! If you hate problem-solving, debugging, or spending hours staring at a screen, then coding might not be your jam. And that’s totally fine."

"There are plenty of other valuable roles in tech, like design, project management, or digital marketing. You don’t have to code to succeed in tech — just find what makes you excited."

"So, should you learn to code in 2025?"

"If you love problem-solving, creating things, or want a skill that’s in demand across the globe, then YES! Coding is still one of the best investments you can make in yourself. It’s versatile, future-proof, and opens doors to endless opportunities."

"But if it doesn’t excite you, don’t force it. The tech world is massive, and there’s a place for everyone."
